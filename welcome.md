# Python Data Structures Tutorial

### Welcome to the python data structure tutorial where you will learn about 3 different data structures that are essential to understand as a python programmer. The data structures you will be learning about are:

* [Stacks](stacks.md)
* [Linked lists](linked-list.md)
* [Binary search trees](bst.md)

### After going through each of these topics and trying the practice problems I hope to help you improve your understanding and feel ready to implement these topics in your programming. The solutions to the 'You Try' problems are linked at the bottom of each page.
